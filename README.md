# Personal Finance Manager

Hey there! This is a personal finance management app that helps you keep track of your money, understand your spending habits, and reach your savings goals. Think of it as your friendly financial companion that makes managing money less intimidating and more intuitive.

## What Can It Do? 

- Your Financial Dashboard: Get a quick snapshot of your money - how much you have, earn, spend, and save
- Track Everything: Log and categorize all your transactions, so you know exactly where your money goes
- Smart Insights: See your spending patterns through beautiful charts and graphs
- Budget Buddy: Set limits and get friendly reminders when you're close to overspending
- Your Profile: Customize your experience and manage your preferences
- Works Everywhere: Whether you're on your phone or computer, it looks and works great

## Built With Love 

We used some pretty cool tech to make this happen:
- React + TypeScript (for a smooth, bug-free experience)
- Tailwind CSS (for a beautiful, consistent look)
- Recharts (for those pretty graphs)
- Framer Motion (for smooth animations that make the app feel alive)
- And a bunch of other tools that make everything work together nicely

- Days 2-4: Building the core features that make the app useful
- Days 5-6: Making it look pretty and work smoothly
- Day 7: Fixing bugs and making everything perfect
